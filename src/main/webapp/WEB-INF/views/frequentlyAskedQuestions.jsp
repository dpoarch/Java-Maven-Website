<p><a><b>I tried signing up on your site, but I am not sure my application was accepted.  How do I know if it was?</b></a></p>
<p><a>Once you sign-up, you will receive an email from <a href="mailto:support@hubzonetalent.com">support@hubzonetalent.com</a> confirming your registration.

<p><a><b>I don&rsquo;t have a resume, can I still register?</b></a></p>
<p><a>Yes, you can still register. However, it is strongly recommended creating a resume as employers like to understand a person?s background prior to setting up an interview. If you are unsure as to how to create a resume, you may find it helpful to Google "How to Write a Resume." You should find plenty of free options to help you with this.</a></p>
